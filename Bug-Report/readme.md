We have used atlasian JIRA to raise and track the bug reports.

Here are the bug filing steps we followed,

* Confirm the bug — Reproduce the issue to ensure it is valid.
* Check for duplicates — Verify the bug isn’t already reported.
* Gather details — Environment, build version, device, logs, screenshots.
* Write steps to reproduce — Clear, numbered steps.
* Mention expected result — What should happen.
* Mention actual result — What actually happened.
* Set severity & priority — Based on impact.
* Assign to the responsible team — Developer/team owner.
* Submit the bug ticket — Track for updates and fixes.
